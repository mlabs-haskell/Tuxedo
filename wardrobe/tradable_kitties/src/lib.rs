//! An NFT game inspired by cryptokitties.
//! This is a game which allows for kitties to be bred based on a few factors
//! 1.) Mom and Tired have to be in a state where they are ready to breed
//! 2.) Each Mom and Dad have some DNA and the child will have unique DNA combined from the both of them
//!     Linkable back to the Mom and Dad
//! 3.) The game also allows Kitties to have a cooling off period inbetween breeding before they can be bred again.
//! 4.) A rest operation allows for a Mom Kitty and a Dad Kitty to be cooled off
//!
//! In order to submit a valid transaction you must strutucture it as follows:
//! 1.) Input must contain 1 mom and 1 dad
//! 2.) Output must contain Mom, Dad, and newly created Child
//! 3.) A child's DNA is calculated by:
//!         BlakeTwo256::hash_of(MomDna, DadDna, MomCurrNumBreedings, DadCurrNumberBreedings)
//!
//! There are a only a finite amount of free breedings available before it starts to cost money
//! to breed kitties.
